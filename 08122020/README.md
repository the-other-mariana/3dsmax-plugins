## Notes

Lower bottom has clock-wise vertex orientation, whereas triangle body faces use counter clock-wise orientation. <br />

In 3ds Max, you can't make quads, you need to make triangles.<br />

## Homework

No homework.<br />

## My Results

We did not finish the code, and I had another approach on how to do it, so I coded my own [cone script](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/3dsmax-plugins/blob/master/08122020/my-cone-mariana.ms) the way I had in mind. It gave a desired output like below.<br />
