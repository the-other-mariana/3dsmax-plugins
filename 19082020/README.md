## Homework

First test: do a plugin for custom wine glass cups (copas). 2 Parameters minimum. <br />

Deadline: 31.08.2020 <br />

## Progress & Logic


### 1st Day of Work

First defined 5 essential sections, just as the teapot. Then created a cylinder where each section has N number of `segments`. This is so that if the user inputs `segments = 1` it can still look like the minimum form of a wine glass.<br />

Then just defined each section's radius and interpolated the current radius with the next.<br />
