NAME OF THE PROJECT: Snowflaker Plugin

FINAL OBJECTIVES:
	A plugin that creates a snowflake mesh object that has customizable parameters: number of spikes, subspikes and form in general.

PARTIAL OBJECTIVES:
	PROJECT STAGES
		1. Create a simple mesh ring with customizable sides
		2. Add a spike per 2 sides to the ring
		3. Add a factor that reduces the spikes' size with respect to its distance to the origin.
		4. Create subspikes with constant size.
		5. Create subspikes with reduced size, with a factor with respect to its father spike length.
		6. Create customizable form: in reality, it will be customizable subspike size. Maybe implementing this will involve different functions for length and a dropdown menu.
		7. Play with randomness.
		8. Join vertices as faces.
		9. Fix smoothing groups.
