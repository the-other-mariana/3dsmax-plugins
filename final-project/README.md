# Final Project

My final project for this course will be a plugin that generates snowflakes procedurally. <br />

## Specifications

3dsMax Version: `Autodesk 3dsMax 2020`
Language: `MAXScript`

## Process & Logic

### 1st Round

The first thing is to create a ring of points, which will be the *inner ring* of the snowflake, a ring from which all the spikes will come out of, as extensions of each *even* side. <br />
