## Notes

`Select Object > F3 (pure geometry) > F2 (transparent material)`.

Search for `Snipping Tool`, a very useful screen print and edit tool in Windows.<br />

Cannot create quads in 3dsMax, you must create 2 triangles per square.<br />

## Homework

No homework, but I will check if my [cone script](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/3dsmax-plugins/blob/master/12082020/my-cone-mariana.ms) works when just 1 vertical segment is chosen.<br />
