## Notes

Make a line as a spiral and add a sphere. <br />

Add a Path Constaint (Animation Tab) to the sphere, and select the line. <br />

Add a checkered Standard Material and increase in the spinner its iterations. <br />

The ball's axis in the quaterion is the lateral cone, not the forward one. <br />
