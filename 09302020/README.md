## Notes

Homework was to fix the second jump's bezier curve (reset the iterator). <br />

## Output

[Class code](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/3dsmax-plugins/blob/master/09302020/Jumper3.ms) that makes a sequence of jumps. We are still fixing the fact that the teapot looks at the direction of the jump. <br />
